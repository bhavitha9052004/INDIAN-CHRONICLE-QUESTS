        <p>Home to the largest population of the one-horned rhino on earth, Kaziranga National Park is one of India’s national treasures in terms of flora and fauna. 
            Located in the state of Assam in North-Eastern India, its total area is shared by the districts of Nagaon, Golaghat and Karbi Anglong placing it roughly at the centre of the state. 
            Approximately around five hours by road from Guwahati, Kaziranga National Park stands tall as the epitome of successful wildlife conservation in India. 
            In 1985, it was awarded the status of a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.</p>
        <h2>Wildlife</h2>
        <p>Lying on the floodplains of the mighty river Brahmaputra, rich vegetation covers almost the entirety of Kaziranga National Park. 
            Receiving massive amounts of rainfall each year, at times even crossing dangerous levels, this national park is characterised by tall elephant grass, marshlands and tall tropical broadleaf forests. 
            Here, a wide variety of fauna thrives including the one-horned rhino, Asiatic elephants, wild water buffalo, leopards and Royal Bengal Tigers. 
            Kaziranga National Park is also listed officially as a Tiger reserve and is home to one of the world’s largest population of tigers.</p>

            Other notable bird families which can be seen here include the great Indian hornbill and wreathed hornbill among many others.</p>

        <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <p>In addition to its wildlife and cultural significance, Kaziranga plays a crucial role in conservation efforts, serving as a sanctuary for endangered species and contributing to the preservation of Assam's natural heritage. 
            The park's successful conservation programs and initiatives make it an important landmark in the global fight against biodiversity loss and habitat destruction.</p>
        <p>The property receives the highest legal protection under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and the Indian Forest Act, 1927/Assam Forest Regulation 1891. 
            With over a century of protection, the park has seen a dramatic recovery of the rhino population. 
            Declared a Tiger Reserve in 2007, the park has benefited from six additions to its area, improving management and protection efforts. Government support at both national and regional levels, along with the involvement of national and international conservation organizations, further enhances its protection. Managed under the Assam Forest Department and guided by a legally approved Management Plan, the property is regarded as one of the best-protected and conserved sites in India.
            However, key threats include rhino poaching, riverbank erosion, invasive species, tourism pressure, heavy highway traffic, and livestock grazing, especially in the newly added areas of the park.</p>
