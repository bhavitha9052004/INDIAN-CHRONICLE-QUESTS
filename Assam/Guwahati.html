        <h2>About Guwahati</h2>
        <p>Famously regarded as the gateway to North-East India, Guwahati is the largest city in the state of Assam. 
            It is also the largest metropolis in the entire North-Eastern region of India, making it the most preferred staging point to other destinations in the region.
            Sandwiched by the river Brahmaputra on one side and the Shillong Plateau on the other, this city was formerly known as Pragjyotishpura (Light of the East).
            The name Guwahati is derived from the union of two Assamese words - ‘Guwa’ meaning Areca Nut and ‘Haat’ meaning market.
        </p>
