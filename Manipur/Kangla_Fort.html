        <h2>About Kangla Fort</h2>
        <p>Kangla, the most significant archaeological site in Manipur, stands as a testament to the region’s rich heritage and history. 
            Located on the banks of the Imphal River, Kangla, meaning 'dry ground' in Manipuri or Meetei, was the historic capital and the foundation of the kingdom of Manipur. 
            Over the centuries, Kangla evolved into a strongly fortified city and a center of political and religious activity. 
            The Kangla Palace or Fort, symbolizing Manipur's greatness, once served as the imperial power seat for the Meetei rulers and later as a British bastion. 
            Today, this historic site functions as an archaeological and museum complex, showcasing medieval royal enclosures, temple shrines, weaponry sheds, and the serene Kangla Sha lake, all within formidable earthen ramparts.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Kangla Fort, the traditional seat of Manipur’s Meitei monarchs, reflects a rich blend of history and architecture. 
            King Khagemba (1597-1652 A.D.) significantly developed the fort, building brick walls in 1632 with techniques learned from Chinese PoWs. 
            His son, Khunjaoba (1632-1666 A.D.), enhanced the fortification and added a moat on the western side. 
            The fort faced multiple evacuations due to Burmese invasions, notably during the "Chahi Taret Khuntakpa" (Seven Years Devastation). 
            Maharaja Gambhir Singh eventually freed Manipur, relocating the capital to Langthabal before it returned to Kangla in 1844 under Nara Singh. 
            After the Anglo-Manipur War in 1891, the British took over the fort, later maintained by the Assam Rifles until 2004. 
            On November 20, 2004, former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh handed the fort over to the state government of Manipur, making it a prominent tourist destination. 
            Despite its historical significance as the capital from the legendary God-king Nongda Lairen Pakhangba's rule in 33 A.D. to Maharaj Kulachandra in 1891, the fort has seen erosion in its prominence. 
            The state government is now working on a Concept Development Plan to restore Kangla Fort's beauty and historical value.</p>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>Kangla Fort's architecture blends traditional Manipuri and colonial styles. 
            The fort includes various structures such as temples, royal residences, and ceremonial halls, and was constructed with well-burned bricks standing twenty feet tall. 
            Within its boundaries lie sacred sites, notably Pakhangba’s coronation site. 
            The fort has three entrances: two in the west and one in the south, with the southern entrance connected to the Shree Shree Govindajee Temple by a canal.</p>
        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>Kangla Fort is not only a historical site but also a cultural and religious symbol for the people of Manipur. It is a place of pilgrimage and reverence, with several important rituals and ceremonies being held within its premises.

            The Kangla Palace is a centre of tourist attraction in the North-East and is considered one of the holiest locations in Manipur. 
            The Nungjeng Eekon, a sacred pond believed to be the dwelling of Lord Pakhangba, is said to be one of the 360 major sacred locations in Kangla. 
            Then there’s Nunggoibi, a temple devoted to the Goddess of War.
        </p>
