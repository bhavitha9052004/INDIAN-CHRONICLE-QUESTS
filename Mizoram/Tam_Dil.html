        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Tam Dil, also known as the "lake of mustard plant," is a natural lake located near Saitual in the northeastern state of Mizoram, India.

According to legend, the drought was so severe that the villagers prayed to the spirit of the lake, Tam, for water. Moved by their prayers, Tam appeared in the form of a mustard plant and guided the villagers to a spot where they found a bamboo shoot. They dug at the spot and found water, which eventually filled up to form the lake.</p>
