        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Kohima, the capital of Nagaland, is a picturesque hill station known for its stunning landscapes and rich cultural heritage. Situated at an altitude of 1500 meters, Kohima boasts of lush green hills, dense forests, and a serene environment, making it a paradise for nature lovers and adventure enthusiasts. The name 'Kohima' is derived from the local Kewhi flowers, which are found abundantly in the region.

            Built by the British, Kohima is home to the Naga and Kulkis tribes, known for their vibrant and mystical culture. The city has a rich history, having been the site of intense fighting during World War II, as part of a 64-day battle with the Japanese. Today, Kohima is a blend of modernity and tradition, offering visitors a glimpse into its past through attractions like the Commonwealth War Cemetery, which houses thousands of soldiers from the war. Additionally, Kohima offers a range of attractions including museums, zoos, sanctuaries, and self-governing villages, making it a fascinating destination for travelers.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Kohima was initially inhabited by the Angami Naga tribes, one of the largest of its kind. In around 1840, the British started the incursions to take on the territory which was met by stringent resistance by the freedom loving Nagas, who had never been conquered by any empire before. For this fact, the British took around four decades to capture the comparatively tiny territory. Kohima was the first seat of British modern administration as the headquarters of Naga Hills District in 1879. It has also been etched in history for the infamous Battle of Kohima during the Burma Campaign in 1944 at the time of World War 2. It was a 64-day long war with the Japanese who eventually lost to the allies. Afterwards, post-independence, when Nagaland became a full-fledged state in 1963, Kohima was made its official capital.</p>
        <h2>Places to Visit</h2>
        <p>Some of the popular tourist attractions in Kohima include the Kohima War Cemetery, Kohima Zoo, Dzukou Valley, and the Nagaland State Museum. The city is also known for its vibrant markets and traditional Naga cuisine.</p>
